# Product image matching with supplier selection

This senior project has been approved to be a partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of bachelor of science in software engineering 2021


## abstract üìå

Brands that are available on the market, ‚Äì for example electrical appliances, home equipment, and even clothing, were all imported from China. However, for a typical merchant, importing these items for sale may be too challenging. Due to the fact that all websites are in Chinese. Therefore, we've developed a website system that can assist in locating Chinese products. To find the supplier, users have to input the image into the search box. After system analysis with deep learning, the products that are closest will be found, with their details and contact information, so that users can reach out to the seller. Our proposed system wants the users to get the right products from suppliers in China into Thailand using our systems.
